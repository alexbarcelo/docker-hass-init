# Init container for Home Assistant

Use case:

 - You use a dockerized Home Assistant.
 - Your HASS config files are in a git repository.
 - Your HASS state (i.e. its `.storage` folder) is zipped in a S3 compatible server.

If that's your scenario, this repository may be helpful!

It is still _Work In Progress_
